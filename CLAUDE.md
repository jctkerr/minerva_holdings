# Minerva Holdings

## Business Context

AI-native legal managed services HoldCo. Non-regulated parent company that acquires and integrates legal operations businesses.

### Value Proposition

- **For corporate legal teams**: Scalable, AI-enabled operational support (privacy, cyber, IP, compliance)
- **For law firms**: Operational partner that extends capabilities without competing—enables them to offer integrated advisory + operations
